# Repeated Sampling

Can we predict whether second sampling will be successful and informative/whether enough fetal fraction is in the blood of a mother?

To reproduce the results, run:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate repsam
```

To create the environment. Then run:

```
snakemake --cores <number of cores>
```
